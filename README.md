# ü©∫ Arduino-Based Health Monitoring System

This project is a **portable and cost-effective health monitoring system** designed to measure and display three vital signs:
-  Heart rate using a Pulse Sensor
-  Body temperature using DS18B20
-  Blood oxygen (SpO‚ÇÇ) using MAX30100

It was developed as a **group mini-project** as part of a course.

## Objective

To build a basic yet effective health monitoring system using Arduino that displays real-time data on an LCD and over Serial Monitor.

## How to Run

1. Connect sensors as shown in the circuit photo
2. Open the Arduino IDE
3. Upload the `health_monitor.ino` file to the Arduino UNO
4. Open the Serial Monitor (baud rate: 9600)
5. Watch the LCD and Serial Monitor display live health metrics
